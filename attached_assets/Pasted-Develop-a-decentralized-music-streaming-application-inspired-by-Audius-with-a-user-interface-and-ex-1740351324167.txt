Develop a decentralized music streaming application inspired by Audius, with a user interface and experience modeled after Spotify. The app should leverage blockchain technology to ensure transparent and fair compensation for artists, while providing users with a seamless, intuitive, and visually appealing music streaming experience. Include the following key features and requirements:
Decentralized Architecture:
Build the app on a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum or a similar protocol) to manage royalty payments and music ownership transparently.
Use smart contracts to automate artist payouts and ensure data integrity for streaming metrics.
Spotify-like UI/UX:
Create a clean, modern interface with intuitive navigation, mimicking Spotify’s layout (e.g., sidebar menu, bottom playback bar, and a personalized home screen).
Add features like personalized playlists, music recommendations, and an optional dark mode theme.
Ensure the design is responsive and optimized for iOS, Android, and web platforms.
Core Music Streaming Features:
Allow users to search, stream, and discover music by artist, album, genre, or playlist.
Enable playlist creation, editing, and sharing, plus the ability to follow artists and other users.
Support high-quality audio streaming (e.g., 320kbps) with efficient buffering and offline playback.
Artist Tools:
Provide artists with a dashboard to upload music, manage profiles, and track streaming stats and earnings.
Let artists set royalty terms or pricing, aligning with the decentralized model.
Blockchain Integration:
Use blockchain for secure user authentication, music uploads, and transactions.
Support cryptocurrency payments (e.g., a native token or stablecoins) for artist payouts and subscriptions.
Scalability and Performance:
Optimize the app to handle a large music catalog and user base without sacrificing performance.
Use decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS) for music files to ensure availability and reduce latency.
Security:
Implement strong security measures to protect user data and blockchain transactions.
Ensure compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) while maintaining transparency.
Cross-Platform Support:
Develop the app for iOS, Android, and web, with a consistent UI/UX across all platforms.
Monetization:
Offer a freemium model with ads for free users and a premium subscription for ad-free listening and extra features.
Include decentralized monetization options like direct artist tipping with cryptocurrency.
Community Features:
Enable users to follow artists and listeners, share music, and engage via comments or likes.
Build a community-driven experience with social discovery and curated playlists.
The result should be a fully functional music streaming app that blends Audius’s artist empowerment and decentralization with Spotify’s polished, user-centric design."
